//////////////
overall importance and query-specific relevance
page rank

query length less more easy to serach for the relevence - so the data is more relevent
document that has query length 1 are more relevent on avg than documetns come from longer query

url is the home page or not?

signal 1,2,7,8 no transform
3-6 - right skewed

lot of zero - if 0 is special case
can create a signal9 -- is sig6 == 0 or not

row count -- binned them - 0-9 one bin, 10-99 2nd bin

using svm -taking the log is appropriate
svm, normally distributed - 
substartct the mean and divide by std dev - helps in knn

colinear attr (duplicate signals) - decision tree, svm is robust
but knn not 

recall precision
missclassification error

univariant analysis

of documetn i classified 80% are relevent - not directly say precison is this etc.


result is a home page or not -- home page should be more relevent

svm
decision tree
naive bayes
clustering
knn
random forest
boosting
bagging

simplify the data -

visualize the data set
right tail, outlier
taking the log transform - to remove right tail

signal 5 low mediam high


add 1, take log and round the log -- binning
log base 10 -- 0 to 10 in one bucket
11 to 100 in one bucket


step 1) analyse the "query_length" "is_homepage"
query_len -- 1 to 8 
and 9+
